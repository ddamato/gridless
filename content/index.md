## There is no grid
## The grid is a lie

## The medium is _not_ the message

The grid in design has roots in aligning type before the printing press. Authors would scribe against page lines like old age looseleaf paper. This was further utilized in later printed works which called for varied content to coexist on the same document. These guidelines were later immortalized in Swiss Style Design where they found their way into more dramatic forms of stylized content.

What is important to consider is the grid has historically been tied to the media where the content is permanent on delivery. The person absorbing this medium cannot change the orientation, contrast, language, etc. based on their needs. On the web, each user experiencing content will do so in a different way. Because of this, **the content must influence the layout** on the web.

## The gap in apps

Design applications struggle to provide a proper representation of how a crafted layout will change based on user settings; they can only provide static print layout artboards that allow for only one presentation of the content. They are currently unable to fully realize the significant changes that may occur based on changes that may be present in certain circumstances.
